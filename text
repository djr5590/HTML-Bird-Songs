Bonus
As a bonus idea, try adding another bird page! Here's a list of what you will need:

Find a sound clip of a birdsong we don't already have (try out SoundBible's Birds Page to start).
Download the sound clip(s) you found and then move them into the assets/sounds folder.
Copy the link to the page you downloaded the sound from so you can give credit!
Search Google images for an image of the bird you pick (make sure you set it to Creative Commons Licenses).
Download the image you found and then add it to the assets/images folder.
Copy the link to the page you downloaded the image from so you can give credit!
Create a new HTML page for the bird you picked.
Add the navbar from the other pages and update it with the new bird you chose.
Add the image and sounds with a layout similar to the other bird pages.
Make links that credit the image and sound sources below the sound and image.

When you're done, you can check your answers against the bonus solution code, although we may have chosen a different bird than you!
